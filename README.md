## My Process

### Built with 

- MJML 

### What I learned 

I used this project as an opportunity to learn how to make responsive
emails with the MJML framework. 

### Continued development

I see MJML as a tool that I can use to build 
complex emails. In future projects, I plan on using it for that 
specific reason to streamline my work. 

### Useful resources
